Overview:
This project demonstrates a simple Login System on IBM i (AS/400) using RPG, Display Files (DDS), SQL database tables, and CL program. It simulates a Domestic Flight Booking System login process.

Files Included:

LOGIN.rpgle – RPG program containing login logic.
LOGIN.dspf – Display file for user login screen.

Database:

LOGINPF: Stores login credentials (userId, password, role).
